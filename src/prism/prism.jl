# Assume that the prism axis is orthogonal to the prism base.  This makes it much easier to
# implement surfpt_nearby by separating the axis and base dimensions (i.e., the closest
# point on the surface can be found independently in axis and base dimensions).
#
# Supporting skewed prisms is not impossible, but this will be done in the future if the
# demand is high.

# It is possible to combine Cylinder and Prism by defining a more general prism type that
# accepts any base shape.  We could use Shape{2} to create a 2D base shape and store it as
# a base shape.  However there is one problem.  We want to use
#
#   surfpt_nearby(x_base::SVector{2}, shape_base::Shape{2})
#
# to find the closest point in the base dimension (such a point is on the side of the prism),
# and compare the distance to it with the distance from x to the base plane along the axis
# dimension.  Then, if x is inside the prism for example, then this comparison will tell us
# which of the base and side is the closest surface from x.  However, this means that we
# have to take the difference between the output of the above function and x_base to figure
# out the distance in the base dimension.  Provided that for many Shape types ∆x is first
# calculated inside surfpt_nearby and x+∆x is returned as the found surface point, having to
# recover ∆x by subtraction is not only inefficient, but also suffers from loss of
# significant digits.
#
# Maybe we should have not implemented surfpt_nearby, but a different function that returns
# ∆x, because the surface point x + ∆x can be easily calculated.  Let's consider fixing this
# in the future.
#
# Hmmm...  Because the surface point is not calculated by adding ∆x to x for Ball and
# Ellipse, maybe implemeting a function returning ∆x is not a very good idea.  Then, it may
# not be a bad idea to calculate ∆x by subtracting x from the surface point.  Let's try to
# implement the general prism.
